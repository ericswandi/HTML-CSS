            <p id="desc"> César Ruiz Hernández was eleven years old when a bomb destroyed his home, killing his father and sister and severely injuring his mother. 
            <br>With the help of Specialist Azucena Rocío “Amaru” Quispe, César’s mother Sofia taught him to observe his surroundings, and to avoid the other boys his age who had been drawn into gang-related affairs. 
            <br>She encouraged him to enroll at the Heroic Naval Military School, where he graduated as a teniente de corbeta. He joined the Naval Infantry, then the Amphibious Commando Battalion, 
            <br>participating extensively in anti-smuggling operations and several high-profile arrests. Becoming a member of the Fuerzas Especiales introduced him to the reality that drugs were no longer 
            <br>the primary source of income for the cartels. He began working with UNESCO and INTERPOL to combat antiquities trafficking, where he gained the attention of Rainbow as a mind with a keen tactical 
            <br>sense and exceptional forward-thinking.</p>

                <p id="desc"> There are in fact two incarnations of Sub-Zero, and they are siblings; older brother Bi-Han and younger brother Kuai Liang.
                <br>Both are blue garbed warriors who at different times have used the codename "Sub-Zero", and both have served the Lin Kuei. Both are 
                <br>descended from Cryomancers, an Outworld race possessing the ability to generate and control the powers of ice. However, they were 
                <br>born in Earthrealm and only the younger Sub-Zero would discover his heritage. Kuai Liang bears a scar on his right eye which he 
                <br>received between the events of MK3; in the new timeline , the scar was made by Kano. However, as seen in Deception, the scar has 
                <br>faded away. This may have been caused by the Dragon Medallion's power.</p>

                <p id="desc"> Castellano was born and raised in the quintessential surf community of Oceanside, California. Her father was a respected Colonel in the Marine Corps, her mother a researcher 
                <br>at a nearby biotech company. From an early age, she was known as a high achiever in math and science and as an athletic prodigy. An Olympic hopeful in swimming, Castellano broke her 
                <br>arm in a car accident when she was 16, putting an end to her career. She changed her focus and enlisted in the Navy, while also attending university. After graduating with a degree in 
                <br>Computer Science, specializing in Security and Cryptography, she transferred to the Information Dominance Corps. Castellano’s attention to detail and analytical skill made her one of 
                <br>their most sought-after specialists. She applied to become a SEAL when the position was opened to women and succeeded after several grueling years, acting as encouragement for others to follow.</p>

                <p id="desc"> WWE Champion Brock Lesnar is widely regarded as one of the biggest Superstars in the history of this business. His WWE return in 2012 received an incredibly positive reaction, 
                <br>and he hasn't looked back ever since. Lesnar had left WWE in the spring of 2004, on a sour note. He was eyeing a career in NFL, and was determined to do well as a professional football player.
                <br>Lesnar underwent a 6-week training program and was looking forward to his pro-day, when teams were scheduled to watch him showcase his skills. Things suddenly took a turn though, and Lesnar's 
                life would never be the same again.</p>

                <p id="desc"> Jin Kazama is the son of Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima. Jun's intimate relationship with Kazuya grew and she became pregnant with Jin. The devil within Kazuya attempted to enter 
                <br>Jin while he was still in his mother's womb, but Jun managed to fight it off. Afterwards, Jun moved to a remote location in the mountains, where she raised Jin and trained him in the Kazama 
                <br>family's self-defense fighting style.Several years later, Jun sensed the approaching of a great evil and decided that it was about time she told Jin concerning his origins. She also told him 
                <br>that if anything were to happen to her, he should look for his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima. Jun's premonitions proved to be true, as she was attacked by Ogre four days later on Jin's 15th 
                <br>birthday. Hours after the chaos, Jin, who fell unconscious, then awoke amongst the rubble and began searching for his mother, with no success, enraged, Jin swore revenge. He was then taken 
                <br>in by Heihachi, who began to train him in Mishima-style Karate.</p>

                <br>hanging out, he claims he "grew up in five states, two countries, fourteen different homes, eight fathers, three care homes, two correctional facilities, one beautiful, damaged flower of a 
                <br>mother" and has "served time, my country, your country and myself." Even as a child, he had a history of rage issues and violent impulses that ruined his attempts to fit into society (notably, 
                <br>it is implied that he, in a fit of rage, sodomized his hockey coach with a hockey stick and he implies in a conversation with Cletus that at some point he strangled a clarinet player with his 
                <br>own instrument). Trevor also mentions how he killed various animals and "drifters" even during the early years of his life.</p>

                <p id="desc"> Little is known about Naruto's birth or parentage, and it is very probable that he has no living relatives at all. What is known, however, is that around the time his mother 
                <br>was about to give birth to him, the Nine-tails Demon Fox, or Kyūbi no Yōko, attacked his village, Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf) and the Yondaime Hokage (Fourth Hokage) decided to seal the
                <br>demon away with a forbidden technique inside him, sacrificing his life in the process. Yondaime's wish was for Naruto to be remembered as a hero by the people of the village.Things, 
                <br>unfortunately for him, definitely did not turn out that way. The people of the village needed something to blame and channel their bitterness and loss onto, and he was the perfect candidate. 
                <br>The adults of the village, without known exceptions, knew him and treated him as nothing more than the demon fox that has attacked the village; As a result he grew up alone and isolated. 
                <br>It is implied in the manga that he went through very difficult emotional times and often shed many tears, but kept reprimanding himself for doing so and telling himself nothing would be 
                <br>achieved by crying. Eventually he developed into the loudmouth, hyperactive prankster he was at the start of the manga, though as the Third Hokage (Sandaime) observed (and even Naruto himself, 
                <br>in a moment of rare enlightenment, once admitted this), it is only an act to cover up for his deep insecurity in a desperate plight for recognition.

                <br>of Tokyo, visitors don't arrive by car, they arrive by chartered plane and land at the private airstrip near the mansion. The estate also has its own train station (a green and red sign can be 
                <br>seen on the top of a building, where a train is moving). The Kanzukis' enormous swimming pool has a yacht with a pool on the deck in it, like in Karin's stage from Street Fighter Alpha 3.</p>
